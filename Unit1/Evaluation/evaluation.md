**Develop the following problem with R and RStudio using dataframes for the extraction of knowledge that the problem requires.** 

The World Bank was very impressed with their delivery in the previous allocation and they have a new project for you.

You should generate a scatter-plot that shows the Life expectancy statistics (y-axis) and fertility rate(Fertility Rate -x axis) by country (Country).
The scatter plot should also be classified by country Regions (Country Regions). You have been provided data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required to produce a visualization for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a CVS file, some in R vectors. The CVS file contains combined data from both years. All data manipulation should be done in R (Not in Excel) because this project can be audited in a later stage. 
You have also been asked to provide information on how the two periods. (Hint: Basically the explanation of his observations)

For the solution We have for the request is a create a two charts for representation the information.

one of that is represented to 1960 year  and the other one is for 2013 year

this is a representation for how the information is showing and how  is
scattered 

in the firts chart we show how while  the fertility is better the life expectancy year is less and the second the chart show a
 line trend and less fertility better life expectancy
