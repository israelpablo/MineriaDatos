## What is pair programming?
<div align="Justify">
The method known as pair programming is used mainly in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). Pair programming specifies that there are always two people working on the code at the same time and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of supervising it in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

## What is the advantage of working in pair coding?
Working as a couple on a project, whether it involves scheduling or another procedure, has many advantages. In general, four eyes see much more than just two: the pair programming method minimizes the risk of errors. While one person writes the code, the other visualizes it and concentrates only on finding errors. In general, it is quite difficult for us to detect the errors themselves. It is usually our colleagues who detect them most quickly.

Another of the great advantages derived from communication is the constant development of creativity: the constant exchange that takes place between the pair of programmers causes ideas that might not be had if the work were individual. Intercom also ensures that problems can be better solved in less time. Well, while a person who works alone may be satisfied with the first option that seems best to him, the people involved in pair programming must always justify their decisions to the rest.
